# GPT-3 Chatbot for Data Scientists

## Overview

This repository contains a Python code that demonstrates the usage of the GPT-3 language model to create an interactive chatbot for data scientists. The chatbot takes user input and generates responses using the GPT-3.5-turbo model provided by OpenAI.

The chatbot simulates a conversation between the user and an assistant where the user inputs messages, and the assistant responds with contextually relevant content.

## Requirements

To run the chatbot, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- `openai` Python package (Install using `pip install openai`)
- `gradio` Python package (Install using `pip install gradio`)

You also need an OpenAI API key, which you can obtain by signing up for an account on the OpenAI platform. Replace `"sk-"` with your own API key in the code.
